<h3><?php echo "1. ABC"?></h3>
<p><?php echo "These initials refer to priorities you must put into practice whenever you find yourself in a first aid situation. They stand for airway,
 breathing and circulation. When someone is unconscious, keep their airway open. If they are breathing, keep them in a recovery position.
 Air circulation is paramount so whatever you do; keep the casualtyâ€™s air circulation systems working."?></p>
 <h3><?php echo "2. Preventing Bleeding"?></h3>
 <p><?php echo "A slight or severe injury may cause someone to bleed profusely. In such a situation, you should apply slight pressure to the affected area.
 Look for something you can use to apply pressure and soak up the bleeding. Keep applying pressure on the injured part until the bleeding 
 stops."?></p>
