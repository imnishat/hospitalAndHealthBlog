<h3>1. Know your correct mealtime</h3>
<p> A diet chart comprises of 5 small meals in a day with a gap of 3 hours between each meal. A gap of more than 3 hours will increase the
 stress hormones cortisol that will let the body store fat in the belly. If these meals are eaten in a proper time it will keep the cortisol
 levels in check and thus reducing belly fat. Food eaten at the right time will also help in better digestion.</p>
 
 <h3>2. Activities during the day will reduce weight</h3>
 <p>If you are physically active during the day it will help you in reducing weight and you will feel less lethargic. If you are inactive 
 and lacking in physical activity than your body requires some weight loss exercises to pump you up.</p>
